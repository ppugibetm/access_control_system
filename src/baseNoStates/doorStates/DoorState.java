// We used the State Design Pattern because it allows the doorâ€™s behavior to change dynamically
// based on its state (locked or unlocked). This pattern makes the system more flexible and easier
// to extend with new states, without modifying the existing code.

// This class defines the common behaviors (methods) that all door states must implement.
// It ensures that all concrete states (like LockedState and UnlockedState) provide implementations
// for opening, closing, locking, and unlocking the door.
